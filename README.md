# Customer Inbox Triage App

> **Assessment changes:** see [IMPROVEMENTS.md](IMPROVEMENTS.md) for the issues found, what was changed, and test results.

## Overview

The Customer Inbox Triage app is a lightweight AI-powered tool that helps classify customer support messages and recommend actions. It uses Groq AI to categorize messages, applies rule-based urgency scoring, and suggests next steps based on predefined templates.

## Problem Statement

Support teams waste time manually reading and triaging customer messages. This tool provides an automated first pass at classification to help prioritize and route messages more efficiently.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: Groq API (Llama 3.3 70B - Free tier)
- **Runtime**: Browser-based (local development only)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Groq API key (FREE - get from https://console.groq.com)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "L2 assessment"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Groq API Key**
   
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` and add your Groq API key:
   ```
   VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your-actual-key-here
   ```
   
   Get your FREE API key from: https://console.groq.com/keys
   
   **Why Groq?** Groq offers a generous free tier with fast inference and no credit card required!

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## How It Works

1. **Paste Message**: User pastes a customer support message into the text area
2. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Message" to process the input
3. **Classification**: The app runs three processes in parallel:
   - **Category Classification** (LLM): Uses Groq AI (Llama 3.3 70B) to categorize the message
   - **Urgency Scoring** (Rule-based): Applies simple rules to determine urgency
   - **Recommendation** (Template-based): Maps category to a recommended action
4. **Display Results**: Shows category, urgency tag, recommended action, and AI reasoning
5. **History**: All analyses are saved to localStorage and viewable in the History tab


## Example Test Messages

Try analyzing these messages to see how the triage system works:

### Example 1: Production Issue
```
Our production server is down
```

### Example 2: Customer Feedback
```
Hi there! I just wanted to say thank you for your amazing customer service. I've been using your product for three years now and I'm really happy with it. Keep up the great work!
```

### Example 3: Feature Request
```
I would love to see a dark mode option in the app. It would be much easier on my eyes during night time usage.
```

### Example 4: Payment Issue
```
I tried to update my payment method but the page keeps loading forever. Is this a known issue?
```

### Example 5: Billing Question
```
Can I upgrade my subscription to the pro plan?
```

### Example 6: Technical Support
```
The dashboard won't load when I try to access it. I've tried refreshing but it keeps timing out.
```

## Security Note

⚠️ **Warning**: This application exposes the Groq API key in the browser (using `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`). This is acceptable for local development only but should **NEVER** be done in production. In a real application, API calls should be made from a secure backend server.

## Why Groq?

- ✅ **Completely Free** - No credit card required
- ✅ **Fast Inference** - Groq's LPU technology is incredibly fast
- ✅ **Generous Limits** - ~14,400 requests/day on free tier
- ✅ **High Quality** - Llama 3.3 70B performs excellently
- ✅ **Easy Signup** - Get started in minutes at https://console.groq.com
